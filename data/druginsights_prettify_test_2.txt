Also contraindicated in children with known or suspected renovascular disease, unless the blood pressure cannot be controlled by other drugs.' dosages_and_how_it_should_be_taken='Treatment should be initiated with very low doses. In some children, the diuretic dose may need to be reduced or the diuretic discontinued at least 24 hours beforehand. If high-dose diuretic therapy cannot be stopped, close observation is recommended after administration of the first dose of ACE inhibitor, for at least 2 hours or until the blood pressure has stabilised.' what_happens_if_i_miss_a_dose='Not specified in the provided text.' what_happens_if_i_overdose='Not specified in the provided text.' what_should_i_avoid_while_taking_the_medication='Potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium-containing salt substitutes should be avoided as they increase the risk of hyperkalaemia.

name='Beta-Blockers' diseases_and_usecases='Beta-blockers are used in the treatment of hypertension, arrhythmias, and to control the pulse rate in children with phaeochromocytoma.' warnings='Dosage reduction is often necessary in renal impairment. Beta-blockers can precipitate asthma and should usually be avoided in children with a history of asthma or bronchospasm. They can affect carbohydrate metabolism causing hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia in children with or without diabetes.

They should be avoided in children with a history of asthma or bronchospasm, and in those with frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia.' dosages_and_how_it_should_be_taken='Some beta-blockers, such as atenolol, have an intrinsically longer duration of action and need to be given only once daily. Dosage reduction is often necessary in renal impairment. In general, the dose of beta-blocker does not have to be high.
